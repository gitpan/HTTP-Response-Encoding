NAME
    HTTP::Response::Encoding - Adds encoding() to HTTP::Response

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
      use LWP::UserAgent;
      use HTTP::Response::Encoding;

      my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new();
      my $res = $ua->get("http://www.example.com/");
      warn $res->encoding;
      print $res->decoded_content;

EXPORT
    Nothing.

METHODS
    This module adds the following methods to HTTP::Response objects.

    "$res->encoding"
      Tells the content encoding in the canonical name in Encode. Returns
      undef if it can't.

      For most cases, you are more likely to successfully find encoding
      after GET than HEAD. HTTP::Response is smart enough to parse

        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=whatever"/>

      But you need the content to let HTTP::Response parse it. If you don't
      want to retrieve the whole content but interested in its encoding, try
      something like below;

        my $req =  HTTP::Request->new(GET => $uri);
        $req->headers->header(Range => "bytes=0-4095"); # just 1st 4k
        my $res = $ua->request($req);
        warn $res->encoding;

    "$res->decoded_content"
      Returns "$res->content" but decoded to Perl utf8 string.

      Roughly equivalent to the code below.

        Encode::decode($res->encoding, $res->content)

      Note it croaks when $res->encoding is false. So you should check
      "$res->encoding" before using this method.

        # i.e.
        $content = $res->decoded_content if $res->encoding.

      Also note that the meta tag remains intact.
